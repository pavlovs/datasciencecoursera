# Test Github
## Learning Progress

Right now I am trying to get this file loaded onto github.
What I learned already:
- $ git init gets the files from the url onto the computer
- how to write a markdown file
- for example check out [datasciencecoursera](https://github.com/pavlovs/datasciencecoursera)


Let's see if this works
